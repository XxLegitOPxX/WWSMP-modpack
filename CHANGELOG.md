# v0.1.0
- Initial version

# v0.2.0 - 2023-12-16
- Added client, shared and server mods folders
 - Each folder contains Full, Medium and Optional mod installations. You must
   use matching mod installations, so if the server is using Full, you must
   also use Full. Optional mods can be added no matter what installation the
   server is using.
 - NOTE: Medium and optional mod installations are still heavily unfinished.
